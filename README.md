- 👀 I've a passion for automating IT infrastructure and am dedicated to mastering the art of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to IT automation and SRE methodologies,
     and I'm eager to connect with individuals who share a similar vision for robust and resilient systems.
